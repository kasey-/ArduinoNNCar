# Arduino Neural Network Car

You will find here the code for the series of posts related to running neural networks on an Arduino.

This project relies on the library Tinn by Glouw. Thank you very much for your small but fantastic code.

## Step 0 - Run a minimal neural network on an Arduino

## Step 1 - Control the engine on the car

## Step 2 - Read all the sensors

## Step 3 - Understand the commands from the remote

## Step 4 - Tie everything together
